## Command Icon

You need to add a `command-icon.png` file at the root of the project.

### Requirements:
- Format: PNG
- Size: 512x512 pixels recommended
- Transparent background preferred

### Suggestions:
- Use a clock/timer icon
- Use SF Symbols (macOS built-in icons): `clock.fill`, `timer`, `stopwatch`
- Download from: [SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/)
- Or create a simple icon using [Figma](https://figma.com), [Sketch](https://sketch.com), or online tools

### Quick Solution:

Use SF Symbols app (free on macOS):
1. Open SF Symbols app
2. Search for "clock" or "timer"
3. Export as PNG at 512x512
4. Name it `command-icon.png`
5. Place it at project root

### Alternative:

Download a free icon from:
- [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/)
- [Iconoir](https://iconoir.com/)
- [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/)

Or use a simple emoji as placeholder:
```bash
# Temporary solution - create a text file named command-icon.png
# Raycast will show a default icon if the file is missing
```
